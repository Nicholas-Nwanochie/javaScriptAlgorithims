3) Write an algorithm to reverse a string. For example, if my string is "uhsnamiH" then my result will be "Himanshu".
Algorithm to reverse a string.

Step1: start

Step2: Take two variable i and j

Step3: do length (string)-1, to set J at last position

Step4: do string [0], to set i on the first character.

Step5: string [i] is interchanged with string[j]

Step6: Increment i by 1

Step7: Increment j by 1

Step8: if i>j then go to step3

Step9: Stop
