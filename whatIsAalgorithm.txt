1) What is an algorithm? What is the need for an algorithm?
An algorithm is a well-defined computational procedure that takes some values or the set of values, as an input and produces a set of values or some values, as an output.


Need for Algorithm

The algorithm provides the basic idea of the problem and an approach to solve it. Some reasons to use an algorithm are as follows.

The algorithm improves the efficiency of an existing technique.
To compare the performance of the algorithm with respect to other techniques.
The algorithm gives a strong description of requirements and goal of the problems to the designer.
The algorithm provides a reasonable understanding of the flow of the program.
The algorithm measures the performance of the methods in different cases (Best cases, worst cases, average cases).
The algorithm identifies the resources (input/output, memory) cycles required by the algorithm.
With the help of an algorithm, we can measure and analyze the complexity time and space of the problems.
The algorithm also reduces the cost of design.
